## Methods

##### [addListener](../components_arc/ArcPainter/addListener.md)([VoidCallback](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-ui/VoidCallback.html) listener) void



Register a closure to be notified when it is time to repaint. [...](../components_arc/ArcPainter/addListener.md)  
_inherited_



##### [hitTest](../components_arc/ArcPainter/hitTest.md)([Offset](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-ui/Offset-class.html) position) [bool](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-core/bool-class.html)



Called whenever a hit test is being performed on an object that is using
this custom paint delegate. [...](../components_arc/ArcPainter/hitTest.md)  
_inherited_



##### [noSuchMethod](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-core/Object/noSuchMethod.html)([Invocation](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-core/Invocation-class.html) invocation) dynamic



Invoked when a non-existent method or property is accessed. [...](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-core/Object/noSuchMethod.html)  
_inherited_



##### [paint](../components_arc/ArcPainter/paint.md)([Canvas](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-ui/Canvas-class.html) canvas, [Size](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-ui/Size-class.html) size) void



Called whenever the object needs to paint. The given <a href="https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-ui/Canvas-class.html">Canvas</a> has its
coordinate space configured such that the origin is at the top left of the
box. The area of the box is the size of the <code>size</code> argument. [...](../components_arc/ArcPainter/paint.md)  




##### [removeListener](../components_arc/ArcPainter/removeListener.md)([VoidCallback](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-ui/VoidCallback.html) listener) void



Remove a previously registered closure from the list of closures that the
object notifies when it is time to repaint. [...](../components_arc/ArcPainter/removeListener.md)  
_inherited_



##### [shouldRebuildSemantics](../components_arc/ArcPainter/shouldRebuildSemantics.md)(covariant CustomPainter oldDelegate) [bool](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-core/bool-class.html)



Called whenever a new instance of the custom painter delegate class is
provided to the <code>RenderCustomPaint</code> object, or any time that a new
<code>CustomPaint</code> object is created with a new instance of the custom painter
delegate class (which amounts to the same thing, because the latter is
implemented in terms of the former). [...](../components_arc/ArcPainter/shouldRebuildSemantics.md)  
_inherited_



##### [shouldRepaint](../components_arc/ArcPainter/shouldRepaint.md)(covariant CustomPainter oldDelegate) [bool](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-core/bool-class.html)



Called whenever a new instance of the custom painter delegate class is
provided to the <code>RenderCustomPaint</code> object, or any time that a new
<code>CustomPaint</code> object is created with a new instance of the custom painter
delegate class (which amounts to the same thing, because the latter is
implemented in terms of the former). [...](../components_arc/ArcPainter/shouldRepaint.md)  




##### [toString](../components_arc/ArcPainter/toString.md)() [String](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-core/String-class.html)



A string representation of this object. [...](../components_arc/ArcPainter/toString.md)  
_inherited_
